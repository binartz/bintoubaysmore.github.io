      <h2>Self Realization</h2>
      <h5>Oil on canvas, 2023</h5>
      <img src=" ">
      <p>Finding myself in my craft has been something I was struggling with.
        I have gotten to the point where I will continue to create what represents me and what I like 
        rather than what I see online. Trying to get into the tech industry has almost steered me away from being creative.
      I don't have to choose between the two because I can definitely do both. I will continue sharing myself through my work.</p>
